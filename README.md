# Overview

WinCC OA Open Tools is a proposal of extensions libraries for WinCC OA Control Script.
You can reuse parts of this software and include them in your WinCC OA Project without fees or royalties.

The project is based on two principles: not reinventing the wheel and reusing concepts that have been proven in other languages and frameworks.
If you want to join the project as contributor, don't hesitate to contact me.

## streams.ctl (Filter, Map, Reduce)

Hereâ€™s an example to convert a stream and return integer values
```cpp
class Mappers
{
  static public int getLength(anytype obj)
  {
    return strlen((string) obj);
  }
};

dyn_anytype fruits = makeDynString("banana", "orange", "strawberry", "ananas", "peach", "apple");
StreamBuilder b;
Stream src = b.buildStream(fruits);  
Stream mapped = src.map(Mappers::getLength);
mapped.toArray()
-------------
[dyn_anytype 6 items
    1: 6
    2: 6
    3: 10
    4: 6
    5: 5
    6: 5
]
```
